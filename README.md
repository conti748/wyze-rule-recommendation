# wyze-rule-recommendation
This repository presents the 2nd place solution to the HuggingFace challange 
organized by Wyze (you can find out more [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/competitions/wyze-rule-recommendation)).
The challange concerns the implementation of
a reccomendation system for smart home automation rules to users.

The proposed solution employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) implemented 
in PyTorch-Geometric. The model has been trained using positive and negative
sampling from the training-set released by Wyze. Notably, this solution improve
the approach presented in [FedRule](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06812).
